    <p>I'm a software developer, writer, reader, backpacker, radio ham, skateboarder, and jiujiteiro. At least, these are the things I *aim* to be. As in these endeavors, so in
        life and I am no expert. I'll never claim to be either. I am a student above all and discovery is the heuristic. This corner of the internet is the README.</p>
