From an early age, I was fairly certain that computers were what I wanted to do with my life. My obsession began in third grade, where the internals of the class computers were housed in transparent acrylic. Thoroughly captivated by what I saw, I’ve since been determined to contribute to the field of computing. I quickly found a home using the Linux operating system, where I began writing trivial programs in Java. My undergraduate studies formally acquainted me with C, C++, and the Standard Template Library, as well as the core principles of Object Oriented Programming and the soft skills necessary to deliver code to real clients. For my capstone project, I worked with a team to develop a new library management system for use within the computer science department using the MERN stack. With requirements analysis techniques, we were able to successfully deliver a system according to the client’s specification. Outside projects and internships have also reinforced my ability to communicate with team members and product owners, and exposed me to the trials of front-end development and natural language processing. I chose to pursue a graduate degree in artificial intelligence out of a desire to help answer what I believe to be some of the most important questions regarding machine and human intelligence. In my first semester, I worked with a team to develop a model that could classify the COVID-19 vaccination status of patients within Humana Corporation’s network based on over 300 data features using feature engineering techniques and various models. Out of almost 200 competing teams, we placed 16 overall thanks to the robust Catboost algorithm and a wealth of categorical features. My interests now lie in the application of machine learning algorithms in embedded systems and edge devices, particularly autonomous vehicles. In my final year of study, I researched video alignment techniques using various published loss functions training a ResNet50 backbone. These proved effective in action recognition and anomaly detection, as well as other relevant tasks. With still much to learn about this cutting-edge field, I am eager to expand my toolset by working on new and relevant problems.
