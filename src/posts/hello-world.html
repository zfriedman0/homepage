<p>
    Youâ€™ll find this post in your `posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `eleventy --serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. Cheers to the first!
